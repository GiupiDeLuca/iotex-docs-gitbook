# Welcome

IoTeX is a full-stack platform to enable **trusted data** from **trusted devices**, for use in **trusted dApps**. IoTeX combines blockchain, secure hardware, and confidential computing to empower **privacy-focused** devices, apps, and services.

## Explore Developer Tools <a id="part2"></a>

### [SDKs](iotex-antenna-sdk/)

Use your favorite Ethereum tools and libraries to build on IoTeX, port your existing dApps without any change to the code, or import the IoTeX native SDK for advanced features:  
᛫ [Ethereum Development](ethereum-copmpatibility/) ᛫ [Native Development](iotex-antenna-sdk/) ᛫ [Tutorials](smart-contracts/)

### [Core API](reference/node-core-api-grpc.md)

See all available gRPC API calls to interact with an IoTeX blockchain node.  
᛫ [Native API Reference](reference/node-core-api-grpc.md) ᛫ [gRPC proto files](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-proto) ᛫ [Ethereum API](reference/babel-web3-api.md)

### [IoTeX Dapp Sample](get-started/iotex-dapp-starter.md)

Get started with a fully working example dApp using the most popular web development stack: multi-wallet connection, cross-blockchain, and tokens management is all working out of the box in a sleek user interface.   
᛫ [Overview](get-started/iotex-dapp-starter.md) ᛫ [See on GitHub ](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-dapp-sample-v2)

## Build your IoTeX Integration

### [Smart Contracts](smart-contracts/)

Exchange any asset or implement any logic in a transparent, decentralized fashion with IoTeX smart contracts.   
᛫[ ](https://ide.iotex.io/)[Issue Tokens](smart-contracts/introduction/) ᛫ [Faucets](get-started/iotx-faucets.md)

### [Exchanges & Wallets](more-resources/exchange-integration/general-guide.md)

Integrate your software with Payments, Deposits & Withdraws of IOTX coins and XRC20 tokens.  
᛫ [Rosetta API](more-resources/exchange-integration/rosetta-api.md) ᛫ [General guide](more-resources/exchange-integration/)

### [Decentralized Identity](middleware-1/decentralized-identity/)

Give your users the ability to create and control their identities. IoTeX DID applies to individuals, enterprises, and devices!  
᛫ [Overview](https://docs.iotex.io/developer/did/overview.html) ᛫ [ioctl commands](https://docs.iotex.io/developer/ioctl/did.html)

### [ioTube Ethereum & BSC Bridge](https://tube.iotex.io)

Extend the reach of your ERC20 or BEP20 Token to the IoTeX Blockchain to run transactions-intensive tasks  
[Submit your Token](https://github.com/iotexproject/ioTube/issues/new?assignees=guo&labels=Token-Pending-Review&template=iotube-new-token-submission.md&title=) ᛫ [ioTube App ](https://tube.iotex.io/)
