# Install ioctl cli

The most basic tool for an IoTeX developer to get started is **ioctl**: a command-line IoTeX client that can communicate with an IoTeX ****[gateway](https://docs.iotex.io/introduction/node-concept) node, allowing you to query and send [actions](https://docs.iotex.io/introduction/action-concept) to the blockchain. 

**ioctl** is a powerful tool to interact with the IoTeX blockchain, and it also provides additional utility commands that can be used locally: we will see some of the basic commands that you need to get started with ioctl and the IoTeX Blockchain!

You can quickly download and install the latest release of ioctl by typing the following command in a terminal window:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Linux and macOS" %}
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotexproject/iotex-core/master/install-cli.sh | sh
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
{% hint style="danger" %}
Currently, **ioctl**  is not supported on Windows systems.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
