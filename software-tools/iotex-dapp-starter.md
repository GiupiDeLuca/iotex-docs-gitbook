Alternatively, you can clone the [GitHub repository ](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-dapp-sample-v2)directly with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-dapp-sample-v2.git

```

Once the repository is cloned, you can start the demo app with:

```bash
cd iotex-dapp-sample-v2
yarn install
yarn start
```

See the demo app running on your local machine at [localhost:3000, ](http://localhost:3000/)and start adding your features from there!
