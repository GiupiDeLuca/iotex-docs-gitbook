# Ethereum Tools

IoTeX is a  100% EVM-compatible smart contract platform, which means it supports **Solidity** as a smart contract programming language,  allowing for any  [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/it/) dApps to be easily ported to IoTeX, **with no changes to the contracts**. 

While this is already a great advantage for Ethereum developers who want to build \(or extend\) their products to the IoTeX ecosystem, IoTeX also implements an **Ethereum-node API wrapper**, called [**Babel**](../../reference/babel-web3-api.md): thanks to the [Babel service](../../reference/babel-web3-api.md), it is now very easy for developers to port their Ethereum clients to IoTeX by just [changing the endpoint in the web3.js](web3.js.md) constructor. 

The same way, developers and users can now take advantage of the rich ecosystem of Ethereum tools to build on IoTeX: applications like [MetaMask](metamask.md), [Truffle](truffle.md) or [Subgraph](subgraph.md) can work with IoTeX by just pointing them to a Babel Endpoint!
