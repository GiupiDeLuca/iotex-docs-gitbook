# Command line client

The most basic tool for an IoTeX developer to get started is **ioctl**: a command-line IoTeX client that can communicate with an IoTeX ****[gateway](https://docs.iotex.io/introduction/node-concept) node, allowing you to query and send [actions](https://docs.iotex.io/introduction/action-concept) to the blockchain.

**ioctl** is very helpful when you need to interact with the IoTeX blockchain. It also provides additional utility commands that come in handy locally**,** like account management and message signature. This section will go through some of the basic commands you need to get started with **ioctl** and the IoTeX Blockchain!
