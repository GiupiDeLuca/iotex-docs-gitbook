# IoTeX dApp Starter

The **IoTeX dApp Sample** is a comfortable environment for **learning IoTeX** development and is the best way to build **a new dApp**.

It sets up a basic working example that is cross-blockchain, multi-asset and supports the most popular wallet apps  \(including [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)\) out of the box. The example utilizes the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. Youâ€™ll need to have [Node&gt;=10.17.0](https://nodejs.org/en/).
