# Metamask Wallet

**MetaMask** is a browser extension and a mobile app that handles blockchain account management and helps users securely interact with web dApps. Itâ€™s supported in Chrome, Brave, and Safari browsers, as well as it is available for Android and iOS devices.

Connecting **Metamask** to the **IoTeX blockchain** is as easy as adding a new network in Metamask, and configure it using the IoTeX testnet or mainnet **Babel** endpoints. 

In the following, we assume you have Metamask installed. If you don't, then you can get it from the[ official website](https://metamask.io/index.html), install it, and [import or create a new wallet](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531-Getting-Started-With-MetaMask).

## Connect Metamask to IoTeX

You can use both the Metamask browser plugin or the Metamask mobile app if you want. Here, we will show the instructions for the browser plugin: for the mobile app, the configuration is very similar.

### 1. Add a custom RPC/Network

In the Metamask browser extension, open the "**Networks**" drop-down menu at the top, and choose the "**Custom RPC**" menu item:

### 2. Mainnet and Testnet network configuration

Input the respective network values for IoTeX Mainnet or IoTeX Testnet \(see how to  [Access the Babel API](../../reference/babel-web3-api.md#access-the-babel-api) doc for the actual Network parameters\):
