# ðŸª™ Obtain IOTX Tokens

## When do I need Testnet Tokens?

Testing dApps functionalities consumes IOTX tokens, which can become very expensive if you develop on the IoTeX mainnet directly.&#x20;

The mainnet is used for real-value transactions, using tokens that have â€œvalue."&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Developing or testing directly on **mainnet** can be very costly as, not only you'll consume gas fees when running transactions, but any bugs or mistakes could potentially lead to serious monetary loss.
{% endhint %}

As blockchain developers, you should use the IoTeX **testnet** for your development, where any dApp can be deployed to a production-like network where tokens don't have any real value.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
You **cannot trade** testnet IOTX on exchanges
{% endhint %}

## When do I need Mainnet Tokens?

Mainnet **IOTX** is the native IoTeX blockchain token that is mined on mainnet by IoTeX Consensus Delegates. This is the token that you find on both centralized or decentralized exchanges which holds a real monetary value.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
The **IOTX** token is used to pay fees in the IoTeX blockchain.&#x20;

This means that you must have some IOTX in your IoTeX wallet if you want to perform any action with your assets.&#x20;
