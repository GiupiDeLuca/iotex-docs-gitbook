# Testnet Tokens

The IoTeX **testnet** is a distinct network from the **mainnet**, though equivalent in terms of functionalities, including the existence of an "IOTX" token along with XRC20 tokens.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The testnet is often reset and is itself subject to bugs during the deployment of beta releases of the blockchain.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Test token balances and smart contracts can be wiped out at any time and, as a consequence, test-tokens do not have any real "value.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### [Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/)

The **best way** for any developer to have acces to testnet IOTX is to create a developer account on the IoTeX [Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/) and claim test tokens in their personal profile. \
Simply connect your wallet on IOTX testnet and start claiming test IOTX immediately.&#x20;

### From faucet

Another way to obtain test IOTX tokens for users that may need them for different purposes, other than developing, is to request them on the IoTeX web faucet:

{% hint style="warning" %}
_**NOTE**_: _This will soon be deprecated in favor of an alternative option in the dev portal._&#x20;
{% endhint %}
