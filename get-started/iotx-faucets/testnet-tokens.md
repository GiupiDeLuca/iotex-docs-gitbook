# Testnet Tokens

### Developer Portal

The best way for any developer to have acces to testnet IOTX is to create a developer account on the IoTeX [Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/) and claim test tokens in their personal profile. \
Simply connect your wallet on IOTX testnet and start claiming test IOTX immediately.&#x20;

### From faucet

Another way to obtain test IOTX tokens for users that may need them for different purposes, other than developing, is to request them on the IoTeX web faucet:\
