# Deploy an XRC20 Token

IoTeX fully supports `ERC20` and `ERC721` Ethereum token standards so that you can port any existing Ethereum token to IoTeX with no changes to the code. In IoTeX, `XRC20` is the name of the token standard equivalent to the Ethereum `ERC20` standard, while `XRC721` is the equivalent for the `ERC721`.

In this tutorial, we will deploy a standard XRC20 fungible token on the IoTeX blockchain: first using the popular [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org) for Ethereum, then using native IoTeX tools.
