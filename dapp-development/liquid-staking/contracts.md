# Contracts

[IIP-13](https://github.com/iotexproject/iips/blob/master/iip-13.md) consists in the implementation of two interrelated contracts:

1. **System Staking Contract:** This is the primary contract responsible for enacting the functionalities laid out in IIP-13. It manages tasks such as creating, modifying, transferring, and querying NFT Buckets.
2. **Staking Read Contract:** Specifically crafted to expedite the process of querying Buckets.

The full implementation of IIP-13 can be [found on GitHub here](https://github.com/iotexproject/iip13-contracts):
