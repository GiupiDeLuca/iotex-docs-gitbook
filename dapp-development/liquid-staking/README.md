# Liquid Staking

Staking on IoTeX L1 is implemented natively, which prevents direct interaction with smart contracts. To address this limitation, we've introduced a feature that represents IoTeX staking buckets as **Non-fungible Tokens** (NFTs). This allows liquid staking solutions that rely on smart contracts to manage their stakes via system-level smart contracts.

The subsequent sections of this documentation provide comprehensive reference material to engage with staking buckets on IoTeX using these contracts and offer essential examples.
