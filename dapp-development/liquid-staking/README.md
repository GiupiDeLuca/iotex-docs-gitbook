# Liquid Staking

Staking on the IoTeX L1 is natively implemented, which precludes direct interaction with smart contracts. In response to this limitation, we've introduced a native feature that represents staking buckets as Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the IoTeX blockchain. This means liquid staking solutions that depend on smart contracts can now manage their stakes via system-level smart contracts. For more in-depth information, please refer to [IIP-13](https://github.com/iotexproject/iips/blob/master/iip-13.md).
