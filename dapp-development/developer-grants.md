# Developer Grants

Introducing the new and improved Halo Grants Program, designed to empower developers to create and launch next-generation decentralized applications (DApps) across various verticals, including **DeFi**, **NFT**/**Gaming**, **Infra/Dev Tooling**, and most importantly, **DePIN** (Decentralized Private Infrastructure Networks).

The Halo Grants Program now features two main grants: The Developer Grants and The Project Grants. The **Developer Grants** are designed for individual developers with different skill sets and experiences, consisting of three distinct tiers â€“ The IoTeX **Learner**, The IoTeX **Explorer**, and The IoTeX **Builder**. These tiers guide developers through a progressive learning path, culminating in the completion of the IoTeX Developer Program.

On the other hand, The **Project Grants** are tailored for established web3 or IoT companies, with two focused tiers: The **Integration Tier** and The **DePIN Incubator**. These tiers are aimed at supporting the integration of existing projects into the IoTeX ecosystem and fostering the development of new DePIN projects from scratch.

With the Halo Grants Program, the IoTeX Foundation provides technical guidance, financial support, marketing assistance, community engagement, and investment opportunities for both technical and non-technical builders. By fostering innovation and collaboration within the IoTeX ecosystem, the Halo Grants Program aims to pave the way for groundbreaking DePIN projects and other pioneering DApps that will redefine the future of decentralized technology.
