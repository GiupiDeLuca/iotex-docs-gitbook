# Developer Grants

The Halo Grants Program is designed to empower developers to create and launch next-generation decentralized applications (DApps) across various verticals, including DeFi, NFT, Gaming, Infra/Dev Tooling, and most importantly, DePIN (Decentralized Private Infrastructure Networks).

The Halo Grants Program welcomes projects at any stage of development, as long as they contribute to the growth, adoption, and advancement of IoTeX technology, ecosystem, and community. The program offers a tiered structure with four distinct levels â€“ The IoTeX Learner, The IoTeX Wanderer, The IoTeX Seeker, and The IoTeX Legend â€“ catering to developers with different skill sets and project requirements.

With the Halo Grants Program, the IoTeX Foundation provides technical guidance, financial support, marketing assistance, community engagement, and investment opportunities for both technical and non-technical builders. By fostering innovation and collaboration within the IoTeX ecosystem, the Halo Grants Program aims to pave the way for groundbreaking DePIN projects and other pioneering DApps that will redefine the future of decentralized technology.
