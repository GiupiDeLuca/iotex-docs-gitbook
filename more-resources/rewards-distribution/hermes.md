# Hermes

The IoTeX Network utilizes Roll-DPoS consensus, where community-elected Delegates manage consensus on behalf of the network. Delegates receive IOTX rewards for their services \(e.g., producing blocks\), which they can share with their voters. 

**Hermes** is designed to bring reliability and transparency to the rewards distribution process for both Delegates and voters. With Hermes, Delegates can auto-distribute rewards every day, while their voters can easily track their reward payments. Delegates that currently use Hermes have a ‘Hermes’ badge on the voting website:
