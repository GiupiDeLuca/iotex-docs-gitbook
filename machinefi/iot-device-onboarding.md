# IoT Device Onboarding

## **Establishing Device Ownership and Value**

The onboarding process for IoT devices within the MachineFi ecosystem is critical to enable seamless integration and value generation. This process involves a crucial step known as "**device binding**," wherein each IoT device is associated with its owner's blockchain wallet address.&#x20;

This binding ensures that device ownership is securely recorded on the blockchain, allowing the owner to manage and benefit from the value generated by each device. Moreover, owners have the flexibility to securely transfer device ownership to other accounts if needed.

The onboarding process may vary depending on the type of device and its design for decentralized applications (dApps) or traditional Web2-based usage. For dApp-friendly devices (those that have been built with dApps in mind), the process often involves straightforward integration with the MachineFi infrastructure, leveraging  the Crypto SDKs to abstract complex cryptographic operations.&#x20;

Conversely, existing Web2-based devices may require additional steps to bridge the gap between traditional IoT functionality and the web3-ready environment of MachineFi applications.

By establishing a robust device binding protocol, the MachineFi ecosystem ensures that each IoT device becomes an active participant, contributing to data streams and financialization, and unlocking the full potential of machines in the digital economy.
