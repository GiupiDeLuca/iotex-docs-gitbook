# DApp Launch Process

## **MachineFi DApp Launch Process**

Launching a successful MachineFi DApp involves a structured and methodical approach.&#x20;

The project team can follow these steps to ensure a seamless and efficient DApp launch:

1. **Specify the Number of W3bStream Nodes and Chosen Consensus Algorithm:** Determine the required number of W3bStream nodes that will power the DApp's data processing and financialization. Additionally, choose the most suitable consensus algorithm that aligns with the project's scalability and security requirements.
2. **Specify IoT Device Type and Quantities (Optional):** If the DApp involves IoT devices, identify the specific device type and quantities needed to support the DApp's functionalities. This step is optional, depending on the nature of the DApp.
3. **Release Business Logic as a WASM Module on the MachineFi Portal:** Develop and release the DApp's core business logic as a WebAssembly (WASM) module on the MachineFi portal. This module will serve as the backbone of the DApp's operations, enabling seamless execution on the W3bStream nodes.
4. **Sign Up the Specified Number of W3bStream Nodes:** Enroll the required number of W3bStream nodes to support the DApp's computational network. Ensure that these nodes meet the project's hardware and performance criteria.
5. **Sign Up the IoT Devices Continuously Until the Specified Number is Reached:** If IoT devices are part of the DApp's architecture, sign up these devices continuously until the desired number is achieved. This step ensures sufficient data streams for the DApp's operations.
6. **Provide Business Logic for Node Operators:** Share the released WASM module with the node operators. These operators will run the business logic on their W3bStream nodes, enabling the decentralized processing of data and financial interactions.
7. **Configure IoT Devices with W3bStream Node Endpoints:** Set up the IoT devices by configuring them with the appropriate endpoints of the W3bStream nodes. This ensures a seamless flow of data and transactions between the devices and the computational network.

By diligently following these steps, the project team can successfully launch their MachineFi DApp, tapping into the power of decentralized data processing, financialization, and innovative applications enabled by IoTeX's visionary MachineFi infrastructure.
