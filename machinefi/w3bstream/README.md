**W3bStream** is a general framework for connecting devices, machines in physical world to blockchains world. In a nutshell, W3bStream uses the IoTeX blockchain to orchestrate a decentralized gateway network (i.e., _W3bStream nodes_) that streams encrypted data from IoT devices and machines and generate proofs to blockchains. Developers builds their dapps with real world data access on the W3bStream framework.

### Use cases <a href="#use-cases" id="use-cases"></a>

**W3bStream** allows the easy creation of **DAOs of** **groups of devices** or machines for a specific application. For example blockchain **oracles** can be easily deployed: a **** group of things that work together to commit verifiable telemetry or intelligence they produced to the blockchain metaverse.&#x20;

Below is a short list of possible oracles that can be built:

* Proof-of-presence
* Proof-of-interaction
* Geofencing
* Weather/traffic/carbon derivatives
* Trade of droid/satellite images
* Decentralized machine learning

**Mechanical Turks** are a group of things that pool their utilities together for a common goal. These can also be bootstrapped thanks to W3bStream.&#x20;

Typical examples include:

* Raspberry Pis that **** work together to stress-test a website.
* A fleet of autonomous vehicles that run an Uber-like business.
* Solar panels trade energy in a P2P fashion.
