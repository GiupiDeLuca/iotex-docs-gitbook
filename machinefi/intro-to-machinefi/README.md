[**MachineFi**](broken-reference) is the core methodology developed by IoTeX to financialize the utility and data stream coming from machines, incentivize their deployment, and enable composable and transparent ways of building innovative applications.&#x20;

More information about MachineFi can also be found in the [**MachineFi Vision Paper**](https://cdn.iotex.io/machinefi/IoTeX%202.0.pdf).&#x20;
