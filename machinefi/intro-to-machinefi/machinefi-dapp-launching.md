# MachineFi dApp Launching

For launching a MachineFi Dapp, a project team needs to complete the following steps:

1. Specify **the number of W3bstream nodes** and the chosen consensus algorithm;
2. Specify the **IoT device type** and quantities (optional);
3. Release the **business logic** as a WASM module on the [MachineFi portal](https://portal.machinefi.com);
4. Sign up the specific number of **W3bstream nodes**;
5. Sign up the **IoT devices** continuously until the specific number is reached;
6. Provide **the business logic** for node operators to run on W3bStream nodes;
7. **Configure the IoT devices** with the endpoints of the W3bStream nodes.
