# Submit a Grant Request

When submitting a proposal, the first step is to determine which grant tier best suits you or your team. To learn more about the most appropriate grant for you or your team, refer to the either the [**Developer Grants**](../../dapp-development/developer-grants.md) or the [**Projects Grants**](../project-grants/) sections in this documentation.&#x20;

The [Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/) serves as an excellent starting point for submitting your grant proposal and exploring the latest submissions from other projects.&#x20;

Our **Project Grants** are managed through a web3 native service called [Questbook](https://questbook.app/), which promotes transparency and decentralization.

Once you have selected the appropriate grant tier for your project, you will be ready to embark on your journey. Click on the chosen tier to access additional information, view active proposals, and participate in open discussions between builders, reviewers, and the IoTeX team.&#x20;

You will now be directed to the _**Questbook**_ _**Proposal Form**_, where youâ€™ll need to provide information about yourself, you email and the wallet youâ€™d like to associate with the proposal (i.e., where youâ€™d like to receive the funds), as well as the details about the proposal itself.

When you're done with your builder details, it's time to add your proposal description!&#x20;

Be as specific as possible when describing your proposal.&#x20;

### Please, refer to the [**Integration Tier Guidelines**](../project-grants/the-integration-tier.md#milestone-guidelines)  or [**DePIN Incubator guidelines**](../project-grants/the-depin-incubator.md#milestone-guidelines) depending on which grant you're applying for.&#x20;

ðŸ’¡ The [**Grant Verticals**](../grant-verticals/) section or the [**DePIN Submission Ideas**](../halo-grants-program/depin-submission-ideas.md) page are also great places to find inspiration and tips for a successful application.&#x20;

When setting milestones for your proposal and determining the funding amount, ensure that you adhere to the requirements and expectations outlined for the grant tier youâ€™re applying for.&#x20;

For more information on milestones and requirements, refer to the [_**Project Grants**_](../project-grants/) section in this documentation.&#x20;

Submit when you're ready to go, and your grant proposal will be recorded on the blockchain!&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
While we encourage you to be as comprehensive as possible in your proposal, keep in mind that there is always time for edits afterwards, so don't stress too much about it.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Once your proposal has been successfully created, you have the option of subscribing to live Telegram notifications, which will make the communication between your team, reviewers and the IoTeX Team much more efficient.&#x20;

Once live, your proposal may be approved by community reviewers or IoTeX team members, asked to make modifications, or potentially rejected. If you get a tag like the one highlighted in the image below, it means that your proposal has been accepted.

In the meantime, you should now see a screen similar to the one just above. Anyone in the community can now see and join the discussion on your project. The goal is to have an open and transparent conversation and allow the community to participate in the decision making process.&#x20;

Use this page to communicate with your reviewers or the IoTeX team, and to submit your milestones for review! **You're now officially part of the Halo Grants Program! ðŸŽ‰**
