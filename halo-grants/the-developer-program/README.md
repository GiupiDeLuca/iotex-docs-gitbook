# The Developer Program

Welcome to the IoTeX Developer Program, a key component of the newly restructured Halo Grants Program. Our mission is to empower developers with diverse skill sets and backgrounds to explore, create, and innovate within the IoTeX ecosystem.

The Developer Program consists of three distinct tiers: The IoTeX Learner, Wanderer, and Seeker. Each tier is specifically designed to support individual developers in their learning journey, regardless of their preferred project category, such as DeFi, DePIN, NFT, Gaming, Infrastructure, or Developer Tooling. By successfully completing each level, developers can unlock the next one with a Soul Bound Token (SBT), signifying their accomplishments and expertise.

Throughout the Developer Program, developers will encounter progressive challenges and expectations, reflecting their growth and skills development. By providing essential resources, mentorship, and financial support, we aim to help developers realize their full potential and contribute to the long-term success of the IoTeX ecosystem.
