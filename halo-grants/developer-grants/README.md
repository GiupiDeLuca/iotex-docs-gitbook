# Developer Grants

Welcome to the IoTeX **Developer Grants**, a key component of the newly restructured Halo Grants Program. These grants are targeted at individual developers with diverse skill sets and backgrounds to explore, create, and innovate within the IoTeX ecosystem.

Developer Grants have three distinct tiers: the _Learner_, _Explorer_, and _Builder_. Each tier is designed to support individual developers in their learning journey, regardless of their preferred project category, such as DeFi, DePIN, NFT, Gaming, Infrastructure, or Developer Tooling. By successfully completing each tier, developers can unlock the next one with a Soul Bound Token (SBT), signifying their accomplishments and expertise.

Developers will encounter progressive challenges and expectations throughout the Developer Grants, reflecting their growth and skills development. By providing essential resources, mentorship, and financial support, we aim to help developers realize their full potential, graduate to become "IoTeX Builders", and contribute to the long-term success of the IoTeX developer community.
