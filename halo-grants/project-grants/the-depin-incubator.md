<summary>Milestone Guidelines</summary>

* **Number of Milestones:** \
  We encourage projects to stick to 3 or 4 milestones, unless strictly necessary.
* **Completion Time:** \
  Completing a submission should not take much more than 6 months (if you're applying for a larger project, think about splitting it into multiple submissions)
* **Metrics:**\
  Each milestone should be directly connected to verifiable and measurable metrics (**number of active devices, volume of IoT data, minimum TVL**, **transaction volume**, **number of users**, etc...). You need to also be able to show how these metrics have been maintained of a certain period of time.
* **Funds distribution across milestones:**\
  5% - 15% - 30% - 50%\
