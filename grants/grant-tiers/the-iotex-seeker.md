# The IoTeX Seeker

The IoTeX Seeker grant is the third level of our grant program, crafted for experienced developer teams with a proven track record, existing marketing resources, and a dedicated community. As a Seeker, youâ€™ll take on more challenging projects that reflect your growth and expertise within the IoTeX ecosystem. With a grant of up to 10,000 USDT, we expect you to build on your achievements from previous levels and deliver production-ready solutions with a reasonable adoption rate. As an IoTeX Seeker, you might embark on projects such as developing a basic DePIN solution based on existing device data APIs, creating a W3bstream-compatible smart device with an open-source design and prototype demo, or launching a simple NFT game. Embrace the challenges ahead and continue to make a significant impact as an IoTeX Seeker.

<summary>Requirements</summary>

* **Proven Team with Existing Marketing Resources:**\
  Applicants should have a well-established team with a proven track record of success in their respective fields. The team should have experience in marketing their products or services, including the ability to generate awareness, engage with their target audience, and drive adoption. This may include access to marketing channels, public relations resources, or partnerships that can help amplify the project's reach and visibility within the IoTeX ecosystem and beyond.
* **Existing Organic Community:**\
  Developers should have already built an engaged and active community around their project or product. This community should be genuinely interested in the project's development, providing valuable feedback, and helping to spread the word about the project's benefits and potential. An organic community demonstrates that the project has the support and interest necessary to drive long-term success and growth.
* **Existing Product:**\
  Applicants should have already developed a product, service, or solution that demonstrates their team's ability to execute and deliver on their vision. The existing product should showcase the team's technical expertise, creativity, and commitment to quality. Having a product of their own also indicates that the team has experience in bringing a project from concept to completion, increasing the likelihood of success for their IoTeX Seeker Tier project.

By meeting these requirements, developers demonstrate that they have the experience, resources, and community support necessary to undertake a successful project within the IoTeX Seeker Tier. This will help instill confidence in the IoTeX community and ensure that the project has a solid foundation for growth and success.

<summary>What we expect</summary>

In addition to the requirements of the previous level, developers should also meet the following expectations:&#x20;

* **Production Ready:**\
  Projects in this tier should be at a stage where they are ready for real-world use and deployment. This means that the product or solution has been thoroughly tested, refined, and optimized to ensure it meets the necessary performance, security, and usability standards. The team should be prepared to support and maintain the product, addressing any potential issues or updates as needed, ensuring a seamless and reliable experience for users.

<!---->

* **Reasonable Adoption:**\
  Given the amount of funding requested in this tier, a reasonable range of adoption should be achieved to justify the investment. This could be quantified in various ways, such as the number of active users, volume of transactions, or level of integration with other applications and services within the IoTeX ecosystem. While the exact range of adoption may vary depending on the specific project, a fair suggestion could be to aim for at least a few thousand active users or a comparable level of engagement within a reasonable timeframe after the project's launch. This demonstrates that the project is resonating with its target audience and that it has the potential for sustainable growth and success.

By meeting these expectations, developers in the IoTeX Seeker Tier showcase their ability to deliver a production-ready product with a reasonable level of adoption. This will help attract further interest and support from the IoTeX community, driving the project's growth and success in the long term.

<summary>Submission Guidelines</summary>

A project in this tier could follow one of these two routes:

1. **DePIN Project Based on Existing Device Data API:**\

   * Present a clear and well-defined problem that the project aims to solve, utilizing DePIN technology in combination with an existing device data API.
   * Showcase the team's expertise and experience with the chosen API, as well as their knowledge of DePIN and its implementation in the project.
   * Demonstrate a working Proof of Concept or Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that utilizes the existing device data API to create a DePIN-based solution.
   * Outline a clear roadmap with milestones for further development, refining the solution, and achieving production readiness.
   * Provide evidence of an existing organic community supporting the project and a marketing plan to drive user adoption.

2. **W3bstream Compatible Smart Device (Open-source Design + Prototype Demo):**\

   * Introduce the concept of the smart device, detailing its features, functionality, and potential use cases.
   * Explain how the smart device integrates with W3bstream technology and contributes to the IoTeX ecosystem.
   * Provide an open-source design of the smart device, including technical specifications, schematics, and documentation.
   * Showcase a working prototype demo of the smart device, highlighting its functionality and compatibility with W3bstream.
   * Present a clear roadmap with milestones for further development, refining the device, and achieving production readiness.
   * Demonstrate the team's proven expertise in hardware design and development, as well as their ability to manage and execute a successful product launch.
