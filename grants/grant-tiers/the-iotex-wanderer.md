# The IoTeX Wanderer

The IoTeX Wanderer grant is the second level of our grant program, designed for developers and small teams who are ready to take their skills and knowledge to the next level. As a Wanderer, you will be working on original projects and ideas that contribute to the growth of the IoTeX ecosystem. With a grant of up to 3,000 USDT, we expect you to not only continue your community contributions but also utilize our layer-2 infrastructure, W3bstream, and integrate hardware into your projects if a hardware kit is requested. Through the Wanderer grant, you will have the opportunity to deploy your project on the IoTeX Testnet and develop a proof of concept or minimum viable product (MVP) that showcases your innovative spirit and technical capabilities. Embrace this journey and harness your potential as an IoTeX Wanderer.
