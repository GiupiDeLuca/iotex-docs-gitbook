# The IoTeX Wanderer

The IoTeX Wanderer grant is the second level of our grant program, designed for developers and small teams who are ready to take their skills and knowledge to the next level. As a Wanderer, you will be working on original projects and ideas that contribute to the growth of the IoTeX ecosystem. With a grant of up to 3,000 USDT, we expect you to not only continue your community contributions but also utilize our layer-2 infrastructure, W3bstream, and integrate hardware into your projects if a hardware kit is requested. Through the Wanderer grant, you will have the opportunity to deploy your project on the IoTeX Testnet and develop a proof of concept or minimum viable product (MVP) that showcases your innovative spirit and technical capabilities. Embrace this journey and harness your potential as an IoTeX Wanderer.

<summary>What we expect</summary>

* **Fulfill Previous Level Expectations:**\
  Developers applying for the IoTeX Wanderer tier must have already fulfilled all expectations outlined for the IoTeX Learner tier. This demonstrates their commitment to the IoTeX community and their continued growth as a developer within the ecosystem.
* **Utilize W3bstream:**\
  Developers in the IoTeX Wanderer tier are expected to integrate W3bstream into their projects. W3bstream is a critical component in the IoTeX ecosystem, and using it showcases a developer's ability to work with advanced web3 technologies and tools.
* **Use Hardware in Project (if hardware kit requested):**\
  If a hardware kit has been requested and received, developers in the IoTeX Wanderer tier should incorporate the hardware into their projects. This demonstrates their capacity to work with IoT devices and integrate them into web3-based solutions.
* **IoTeX Testnet Deployment:**\
  Developers in the IoTeX Wanderer tier are expected to deploy their projects on the IoTeX Testnet. This shows their ability to work with the IoTeX blockchain and develop solutions that can be tested and refined before moving on to the mainnet. Deploying on the Testnet also allows the IoTeX community to provide feedback and support, helping developers refine their projects and address any issues that may arise.

By meeting these expectations, developers in the IoTeX Wanderer tier prove their dedication to creating innovative and impactful solutions within the IoTeX ecosystem while demonstrating their ability to work with more advanced tools and technologies.

<summary>Submission Guidelines</summary>

* **Proof of Concept / Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**\
  Developers should submit a Proof of Concept or Minimum Viable Product that showcases the core functionality of their proposed project. This should be a working prototype or a detailed explanation of the project, including its features, functionality, and integration with W3bstream. The Proof of Concept/MVP should demonstrate how the project aligns with the requirements and expectations of the IoTeX Wanderer tier, such as its originality and deployment on the IoTeX Testnet.
* **Integration of Hardware (if hardware kit requested):**\
  If a hardware kit has been requested, developers should demonstrate how the hardware has been integrated into the project. This can be done through documentation, images, or videos showing the hardware in action within the context of the proposed solution.
* **Testnet Deployment Details:**\
  Developers should provide information on their IoTeX Testnet deployment, including any relevant links, code repositories, or resources that can be used to verify the deployment and its functionality. This will enable the IoTeX community to review the project, provide feedback, and offer support during the development process.
* **Future Plans and Improvements:**\
  Developers should also outline their plans for future development and improvements to their project, demonstrating their commitment to the ongoing growth and refinement of their solution. This can include milestones, anticipated features, or any other information that shows a clear roadmap for the project's continued evolution within the IoTeX ecosystem.

By providing a comprehensive example submission that includes a Proof of Concept/MVP, hardware integration (if applicable), Testnet deployment details, and future plans, developers can effectively showcase their project and its potential to contribute positively to the IoTeX ecosystem.
