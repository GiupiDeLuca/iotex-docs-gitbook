1. **Substantial adoption:**\

   * Projects in the IoTeX Legend Tier should aim for a significant level of user adoption within their target market or industry.

   * The team should have a well-defined plan to drive user adoption, which may include targeted marketing campaigns, strategic partnerships, or other growth initiatives.

2. **Growth/Scaling Plan:**\

   * The team should have a clear and realistic plan for scaling their project, addressing potential challenges such as increased demand, infrastructure growth, or regulatory compliance.
   * This plan should include strategies for expanding the project's reach to new markets, user segments, or industries, as well as the continuous improvement and enhancement of the product or service based on user feedback and evolving market needs.
   * Additionally, the growth plan should outline the necessary resources (human, financial, and technical) required to support the project's scaling efforts, demonstrating the team's commitment to ensuring long-term success and sustainability.

For the IoTeX Legend Tier, projects are expected not only to achieve significant user adoption but also to have a solid plan for growth and scaling, demonstrating their potential to make a lasting impact within the IoTeX ecosystem and beyond.
