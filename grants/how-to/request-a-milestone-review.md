When you're ready to request a Milestone review, simply post about your Milestone in the chat. Remember to add as many details as possible to your Milestone as well as links to your work, or anything that's relevant to the specific Milestone.&#x20;

A Milestone request message could look like this:&#x20;

Go ahead and post your message. Someone from the reviewers team or the IoTeX team will get in touch with you shortly after and the funds will then be granted to the wallet account you provided when you created the proposal.&#x20;

Now it's just a matter of keep working at your project, participate in the conversation, and reoeat the process for your next milestone!
