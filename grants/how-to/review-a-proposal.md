Serving as a reviewer is a crucial responsibility within the Halo Grant Program. After engaging in open discussions, reviewers must carefully analyze all the information, weigh various factors, and ultimately make informed decisions on proposals.

Reviewers are typically members of the IoTeX team or respected individuals within the IoTeX community, such as previous grantees, active contributors, and builders. If you're interested in taking on a more active role within the grants program and becoming a reviewer, please complete the form below. We'll be sure to get in touch with you as soon as possible!
