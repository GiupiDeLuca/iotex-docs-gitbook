# Grant Verticals

In our quest to foster innovation and growth within the IoTeX ecosystem, we have identified four key verticals that hold immense potential for the future of decentralized technology: _**DeFi**_, _**DePIN**_ (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), _**NFT/Gaming**_, and _**Infrastructure/Developer Tooling**_.&#x20;

These verticals span across all grant levels – Learner, Wanderer, Seeker, and Legend – allowing developers and teams to choose the category that best aligns with their expertise and ambitions. For each vertical, we will provide examples of project submissions and suggested milestones, ensuring that applicants have a clear understanding of our expectations and the exciting opportunities that await them in their chosen path.&#x20;

Dive into these dynamic verticals and join us in shaping the future of the IoTeX ecosystem.
