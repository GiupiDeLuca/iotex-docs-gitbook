# Our Grants

At IoTeX, we believe in empowering developers of all skill levels to explore, create, and innovate within our ecosystem. To support this vision, we have designed a four-tier grant program, progressing from beginner to advanced levels.&#x20;

The grant levels: The IoTeX _**Learner**_, _**Wanderer**_, _**Seeker**_, and _**Legend**_, are tailored to suit the unique needs and expertise of different developer teams, regardless of their project category, such as _**DeFi**_, _**DePIN**_, _**NFT**_, _**Gaming**_, _**Infrastructure**_, or _**Developer Tooling**_.&#x20;

As teams advance through the grant levels, they can expect increased scrutiny and higher expectations, reflecting their growth and expertise. This progressive structure allows us to provide the necessary resources, mentorship, and financial support to help teams achieve their full potential and make a lasting impact in the IoTeX ecosystem.
