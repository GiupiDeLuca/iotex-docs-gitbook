# The IoTeX Learner

The IoTeX Learner grant is the first level of our grant program, designed to support and encourage individual developers or small teams who are just starting their journey in the IoTeX ecosystem. As a Learner, you have the opportunity to make a positive impact on the community by contributing to the IoTeX developer portal with tutorials, guides, or project abstracts. With a grant of up to 200 USDT, we aim to help you refine your skills, enhance your understanding of IoTeX technology, and potentially integrate hardware into your projects. Through the Learner grant, we provide the foundation you need to grow within our ecosystem and embark on an exciting path of exploration and innovation.
