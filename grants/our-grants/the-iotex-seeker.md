# The IoTeX Seeker

The IoTeX Seeker grant is the third level of our grant program, crafted for experienced developer teams with a proven track record, existing marketing resources, and a dedicated community. As a Seeker, youâ€™ll take on more challenging projects that reflect your growth and expertise within the IoTeX ecosystem. With a grant of up to 10,000 USDT, we expect you to build on your achievements from previous levels and deliver production-ready solutions with a reasonable adoption rate. As an IoTeX Seeker, you might embark on projects such as developing a basic DePIN solution based on existing device data APIs, creating a W3bstream-compatible smart device with an open-source design and prototype demo, or launching a simple NFT game. Embrace the challenges ahead and continue to make a significant impact as an IoTeX Seeker.
