# The Halo Program

Introducing **Halo**, the IoTeX Grants Program run by the IoTeX Foundation. Join us in building a connected world! The IoTeX Halo Grants Program accelerates the growth of the IoTeX ecosystem and empowers developers to launch next-gen Dapps around **DeFi**, **NFT**, **Gaming**, **Infrastructure/Developer Tooling**, and most importantly, **DePIN** (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) topics!

The Halo Grants Program is designed for projects at any stage and skill level, featuring four distinct grant tiers: **Learner**, **Wanderer**, **Seeker**, and **Legend**. Each tier caters to different developer backgrounds and experiences, ensuring that everyone can contribute to the growth and adoption of the IoTeX technology, ecosystem, and community.

### **Benefits**

The IoTeX Foundation provides technical guidance, financial support (ranging from 200 USDT to 50,000 USDT, depending on the grant tier), marketing support, community engagement, and investment opportunities for builders, both technical and non-technical!
