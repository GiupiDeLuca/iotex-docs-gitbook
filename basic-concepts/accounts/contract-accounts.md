# Contract Accounts

As anticipated, smart contract accounts do not have a private key associated to it, therefore they cannot initiate transactions: a contract address can only be the destination of transactions. On the other hand, a smart contract address has some **executable code** associated to it, that gets **executed** each time a transaction is sent to its address.
