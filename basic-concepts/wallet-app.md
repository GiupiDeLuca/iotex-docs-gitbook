# Wallet App

A blockchain wallet is a tool to safely encrypt and store private keys, sign actions and broadcast them to the blockchain.

[IoPay ](https://iopay.iotex.io/)is the official wallet built by the IoTeX team for everyone to manage their digital assets on the IoTeX blockchain. Additionally, it supports Staking & Voting for Delegates, Fungible Tokens \(XRC20\), Non-Fungible Tokens \(XRC721\), and much more!

Many other existing software and wallet apps have integrated support for the IoTeX Blockchain, check them all on the IoTeX Ecosystem website:
