# Submit your tokens

## Extend your Ethereum Dapp to IoTeX

Any Dapp developer that has deployed a token on any of the blockchains supported by ioTube can [submit their token](https://github.com/iotexproject/ioTube/issues/new/choose) to be added to the bridge. Together with IoTeX's full [Web3 compatibility](../../ethereum-copmpatibility/), you can now extend your Dapp to IoTeX in no time, gaining access to trusted [verifiable IoT data](../../secure-hardware/pebble-tracker/), and run transaction-intensive tasks thanks to the IoTeX **ultra-fast** and low-fees transactions**.**
