# Web2-Based Devices

Traditional Web2-based IoT devices refer to smart devices that have already existed in the market. For those IoT devices, it is usually difficult, if not impossible, to make significant changes to the manufacturing process as well as to the device firmware.&#x20;

This is a possible digital transformation roadmap for integrating the W3bStream framework into **** existing Web2-based IoT businesses.

### Integration steps

A Web2 integration would comprise the following elements:&#x20;

* A Cloud Computing Trust Model
* "Digital Twin" Device Binding
* A Proxy Communication Mode

This guide will mainly focus on the onboarding and integration of Legacy IoT Devices
