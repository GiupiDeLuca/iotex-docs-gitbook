{% hint style="warning" %}
**You need the IOTX Native Token to Stake**

Please be aware that you will need to obtain the Native IOTX token (i.e. on the IoteX Network) for the purpose of staking. Any other synthetic or mirrored versions of the IOTX token on different chains, including the IOTX ERC20 token, will not function for this purpose. If you own these tokens, you will need to exchange them for the IOTX Native Token on the IoTeX Network.

**About the IOTX ERC20 Token**

Most of the IOTX token supply is allocated to the IoTeX Blockchain in the form of the so called IOTX Native token, while a small portion still resides on the Ethereum blockchain as the IOTX ERC20 Token. This allocation dates back to the time when the IoTeX Blockchain was still in development, and can be swapped for the IOTX Native token at any time [using the iotube Bridge ->](https://iotube.org)
{% endhint %}

_**NOTE**_: Make sure to buy tokens on the **IoTeX blockchain** by selecting **IoTeX** as network when making your transactions.&#x20;

It's also very important to point out that the **ERC20** version of the **IOTX** token on the **Ethereum Network** is still tradable on some exchanges, like Coinbase.&#x20;

These tokens are NOT native and they can only be used on the Ethereum network.\
\
Users who own these tokens cannot take advantage of the benefits of the **IoTeX** blockchain, such as staking, high transaction speed and low fees.
