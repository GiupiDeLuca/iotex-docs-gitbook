# How it works

## Proposal categories

The IoTeX Halo Grants Program fuels software and hardware development, as well as industry research, education, and community engagement efforts. We welcome proposals, both tech, and non-tech, in the following categories. If you have impactful ideas that do not fit in the following categories, we are all ears!

The Halo [Grants Program section](https://community.iotex.io/c/halo-grants/61) is intended to introduce users to the program, its rules, and its instructions. Please notice that **you cannot create posts in this category**, however, this is where you can see the list of all submitted proposals, their status, and browse grant categories.

## Exploring proposals

The grants and their current states can be found in the Halo Grants main section. _**Forum Categories**_ categorize proposals, and _**Forum Tags**_ track the status of each proposal.

Users can use the filter bar to filter the list of proposals by category and status:

So far, we support the following Forum Categories: MachineFi, DeFi, NFT & Games, Infra & Dev Tools, Education, Social Impact, Bounties, or Other.

We also support the following forum tags (statuses): Seek for votes, Granted, Issued, or Rejected.

## Submitting Proposals

When submitting your proposal, you are required to select one category that best reflects your project. If your project does not fall into any of the existing categories, then you can use the category "**Other**".

The "[Submitting a new Proposal](https://community.iotex.io/t/submitting-a-new-proposal/3822)" post already includes the **links** to create a new post in each category. Alternatively, you may enter one of the existing categories, and post the proposal in that category.&#x20;

### Proposal Templates

We enforce a **proposal template** when users submit a new proposal. Each category has its own template. Templates are mostly all the same, except that different categories may have some **preset milestones** that are **mandatory** for that specific proposal. Besides project details, all templates always include:

* A Link to the Program Rules
* A preset poll for community members to vote on the proposal
* A placeholder for future milestone reports

### The proposal lifecycle

#### Submission

1. Teams go to the Halo Grants category on the forum,
2. Determine the category that best aligns with their project,
3. Create a post in the selected category by following its template.

#### Evaluation

1. The IoTeX team will tag the new proposal as "_Seeking for votes_"
2. The developers promote the post in their communities and ours
3. The communities comment and vote on the proposal
4. IoTeX optionally promotes the best projects on its official channels
5. IoTeX enters the discussion once there is enough community participation, optionally scheduling a call with the developers
6. Developers edit the proposal based on community/IoTeX feedback
7. If the funds are granted, IoTeX tags the post as "Granted". Otherwise, it will be tagged as "Rejected"
8. Developers add milestone reports to the [bottom of their post itself](https://community.iotex.io/t/example-proposal-cryptopuppies/3840#milestone-reports-12)
9. IoTeX verifies the milestone, issues the funds, and **includes the payment** in the milestone
10. When the project is completed or abandoned, IoTeX marks it as "issued" or "rejected" respectively and **closes** the thread
